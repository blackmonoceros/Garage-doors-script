# Garage-doors-script
Simple example of a Python script that communicates with an Arduino to open garage doors.

Python script that communicates with an Arduino to open garage doors. The Arduino will control a relay or a servo motor that operates the door mechanism. 
Python will be used to send commands to the Arduino via a serial port.

How It Works


Arduino:

The Arduino receives commands through the serial port (e.g., OPEN or CLOSE).
Based on the received command, it controls a relay or a servo motor to open or close the garage door.


Python:
The Python script sends the appropriate commands to the Arduino through the serial port (e.g., when a button is pressed in the application or based on another event).


Arduino Code
First, write the code for the Arduino. Make sure you have the Servo library installed (if using a servo motor) or connect a relay.


Python Code
Below is the Python code that sends commands to the Arduino via the serial port.


Instructions

Hardware:

Connect the Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.
Connect the relay or servo motor to the appropriate pins on the Arduino.
Software:
Upload the Arduino code to the board using the Arduino IDE.
Install the pyserial library in Python using the command:
javascript


pip install pyserial


Run the Python script and type OPEN or CLOSE to control the garage door.


Testing:


Ensure the serial port in Python (COM3) is correct. You can check the port in the Arduino IDE (Tools -> Port).
Notes
If using a servo motor, ensure it is powered correctly.
If using a relay, make sure it is connected to the garage door opening mechanism.
